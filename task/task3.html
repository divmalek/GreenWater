        <h2>Drink more Water.</h2>
        <p> it is recommended to drink about 2.7 liters (11.5 cups) of water per day for women and about 3.7 liters (15.5 cups) for men, as suggested by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Staying well-hydrated is essential to support various bodily functions and improve overall well-being. Proper hydration can help reduce morning anxiety, enhance cognitive function, and boost confidence during social interactions. By consistently drinking enough water throughout the challenge, individuals may experience improved mood, better concentration, and increased overall mental and physical performance, all of which can positively impact how they cope with and manage social anxiety.</p>
